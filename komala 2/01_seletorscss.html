    <h1>Welcome to my bio</h1>
    <p>A full stack developer is an engineer capable of working on both the front-end and back-end of a web application, encompassing everything from the user interface (what the user sees and interacts with) to the server-side logic, database, and overall application infrastructure. These versatile professionals have a diverse skillset, including front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with frameworks like React or Vue, and back-end technologies such as Python, Java, or Ruby with databases like SQL or NoSQL. Their comprehensive expertise allows them to rapidly develop and iterate on minimum viable products (MVPs) and manage all facets of a project's development lifecycle.
